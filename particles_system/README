GOAL:
----
Implements a particle system with physics

DESCRIPTION:
-----------
It has circular dependencies: as a programming exercise I included within a particle, 
references to the forces acting on it; I also kept track within each force of the particles it affected. 
This allowed for the forces to know whether one of their 'customer particles' ceesed to exist,
and viceversa. In the case of binary (n-ary) this could mean that the force was no longer needed, 
so I introduced a link to the particles in the force. Example

Force A is a Spring force and it acts on particles 1 and 2. If particle 1 ceased to exist, then 
Force A will not produce any effect on particle 2, so we can delete the force. Since we introduced 
a reference to Force A in particle 2, we need to notify this particle (so it deletes this reference) 
before completely deleting Force A.

THOUGHTS:
--------
These circular dependencies over complicate things. Maybe I should start with a simpler design where 
the ParticleSystem is in charge of linking particles and forces, and it is also in charge of mantaining these 
links.
